## Description
This project is a simple web crawler implemented in Node.js using JavaScript. The web crawler is designed to navigate through a given website and count the number of links pointing to each page. The goal is to generate a report displaying the pages with the highest number of links.

## Tools Used
1. Javascript
2. Node.js
3. JSDOM
4. Jest

## Run the project
1. Make sure you already have Node.js installed on your system
2. Download or clone the repository to your local machine
3. Open your favorite code editor (which VSCode I'm using in this project) and then navigate to the project directory
4. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
5. To execute the project type `npm run start <website_url>` (example: `npm run start https://example.com`)
6. And if you want to test the project or have something else to add to the logic and test there, you should type `npm run test` to see if the logic you implement is working or not.
7. Lastly, the program will display the progress of the crawl and generate a report with link counts for each page.
